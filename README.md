# Hello everyone!!

This is my personal repository where I put all the codes that I develop during my free time. :v:

You can find some Kaggle competitions that I did and some other works. 

In particular, you can find a complete tutorial on classical use cases but with particular solutions:
- the MNIST dataset: computer vision problem with a mathematical explanation of the deep learning under the hood.
- The Titanic Dataset: balanced classification problem with a robustness technique explaination.
- US Adult Census dataset: imbalanced classification problem with all the possible techniques applied.
- Graph analysis with Spark
- A complete tutorial on GNN with Pytorch geometric
- A fraud detection problem with a graph approach
- A Neo4j Introduction

In addition, you will find:
-  a batch gradient descent with early stopping for softmax regression.

Usually, these projects were explained during my Meetup Conferences with Machine Learning Together Milan.

You can find some of my explanations [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjb-lLu1LyjT9QKEqy-lMquMhceEtAY0t).  :muscle:

If you have any doubts contact me at <juliengenovese@hotmail.it>.
