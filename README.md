# Hello everyone!!

This is my personal repository where I put all the codes that I did during my free time. :v:

You can find some Kaggle competitions that I did and some other works. 

In particular you can find a complete tutorial of the MNIST dataset and the Titanic Dataset.

Usually these projects are explained during my Meetup Conferences with Machine Learning Together Milan. You can find some of my explaination [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjb-lLu1LyjT9QKEqy-lMquMhceEtAY0t).  :muscle:

If you have any doubts contact me at juliengenovese@hotmail.it .

Good bye Folks!:clap:
