# Hello everyone!!

This is my personal repository where I put all the codes that I've done during my free time. :v:

You can find some Kaggle competitions that I've done and some other works. 

Usually these projects are explained during my Meetup Conferences with Machine Learning Together Milan. You can find some of my explaination [here] (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjb-lLu1LyjT9QKEqy-lMquMhceEtAY0t).  :muscle:

If you have any doubts contact me at juliengenovese@hotmail.it .

Good bye Guys!:clap:
