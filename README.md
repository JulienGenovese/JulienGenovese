# Hello everyone!!

This is my personal repository where I put all the codes that I did during my free time. :v:

You can find some Kaggle competitions that I did and some other works. 

In particular you can find a complete tutorial on:
- the MNIST dataset: computer vision problem.
- the Titanic Dataset: balanced classification problem.
- US Adult Census dataset: imbalanced classification problem.
- graph analysis with Spark

In addition you will find:
-  a batch gradient descent with early stopping for softmax regression.

Usually these projects are explained during my Meetup Conferences with Machine Learning Together Milan. You can find some of my explaination [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjb-lLu1LyjT9QKEqy-lMquMhceEtAY0t).  :muscle:

If you have any doubts contact me at juliengenovese@hotmail.it .
